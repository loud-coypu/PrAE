# **Pronunciation of Ancient Egyptian (PrAE)**

## **0. Introduction**

The phonology of Ancient Egyptian has often been overlooked, despite the immense interest in its rich history and cultural significance. Most people approach the language as if it were a chemical formula, pronouncing words in a rigid and artificial manner. For instance, the name Ra is commonly read as /'ra/, but during the Old Kingdom, it was likely pronounced /'ri:3/. This form evolved over time, reflecting its Afro-Asiatic roots, transitioning in the New Kingdom to /'ra/, and eventually surfacing in Coptic as /'ra/.

In this book, we will employ the method of natural phonetics, focusing on a scientific and universal transcription system and an articulatory/auditory approach. By reconstructing the sounds of Ancient Egyptian through this lens, we aim to bridge the gap between historical linguistics, phonology, and modern phonetic science.

This book embarks on a fascinating journey to decode the phonological history hidden in ancient texts, preserved in historical layers, and illuminated by modern languages. It is an investigation that reveals how linguistic fragments from the past can unveil narratives of cultural and historical transformation, offering a glimpse into the voices of Ancient Egypt as they were truly spoken.

### **0.1 Audience and Prerequisites**

This book is designed for linguists, historians, and enthusiasts with an interest in Ancient Egyptian language and culture. While prior knowledge of phonetics or historical linguistics is helpful, introductory explanations are provided for non-specialists.

### **0.2 Purpose and Scope**

The goal of this book is to reconstruct the phonology of Ancient Egyptian by combining insights from natural phonetics, comparative linguistics, and the historical record. It aims to make this intricate topic accessible while maintaining academic rigor.

## **1. Methodological Foundations**

### **1.1 Natural Phonetics: Principles and Applications**

Natural Phonetics, as formulated by Luciano Canepari, bridges the gap between theoretical linguistics and the observable realities of speech. By emphasizing articulatory precision and auditory clarity, this framework allows us to hypothesize the spoken forms of extinct languages with remarkable fidelity. For Ancient Egyptian, this involves decoding hieroglyphic orthography while cross-referencing it with related languages, such as Semitic tongues and Coptic.

Ancient Egyptian orthography, though visually rich, presents challenges in phonetic reconstruction. Hieroglyphic symbols often represented more than one phoneme or carried semantic connotations unrelated to pronunciation. By analyzing their usage alongside Afro-Asiatic cognates, researchers can identify phonetic patterns that resonate with the natural articulation of sounds.

## **1\. Methodological Introduction**

### **1.1 Natural Phonetics**

#### **1.1.1 Prelude**

Phonetics, as the scientific study of speech sounds, provides a crucial foundation for understanding both the spoken forms of language and their representation in writing. In many languages, especially ancient ones like Egyptian, the relationship between orthography and pronunciation can be indirect and elusive. This discrepancy arises from the absence of direct records of pronunciation and the limitations of written systems to fully capture spoken reality.

Luciano Canepari's framework of Natural Phonetics & Tonetics offers a comprehensive approach by combining the study of sound production, auditory perception, and the communicative role of sounds. While primarily developed for modern languages, its principles can be extended to reconstruct extinct languages by analyzing indirect evidence. For Ancient Egyptian, this involves interpreting hieroglyphs, evaluating transliterations into languages such as Greek or Coptic, and examining patterns across related Afroasiatic languages.

Natural Phonetics emphasizes the importance of articulatory and auditory precision, bridging the gap between theoretical reconstructions and plausible spoken forms. In this context, phonetics serves as a methodological tool for hypothesizing the phonological structure of Ancient Egyptian based on available data.

#### **1.1.4 The Phono-articulatory Apparatus**

Speech sounds are shaped by the interaction of the vocal folds, resonators (e.g., the oral and nasal cavities), and articulators (e.g., the tongue, lips, and jaw). Understanding these mechanisms is fundamental to hypothesizing how Ancient Egyptian sounds were produced.

In the context of Afroasiatic languages, including Ancient Egyptian, particular attention is given to features such as labialized and implosive consonants. These features, rooted in the physical configuration of the vocal tract, provide important clues for reconstructing the language's phonetics.

#### **1.1.5 Classification of Sounds**

Speech sounds are traditionally classified based on properties such as:

* **Voicing**: Whether the vocal folds vibrate during sound production.  
* **Place of Articulation**: Where in the vocal tract the sound is produced.  
* **Manner of Articulation**: How the airflow is modified during sound production.

Natural Phonetics extends this framework by incorporating additional parameters to capture subtle articulatory and acoustic distinctions. For Ancient Egyptian, this expanded classification is essential for describing features like emphatic consonants, complex vowel qualities, and coarticulatory effects.

#### **1.2 Reconstruction Method**

The neogrammarian approach will be the basis.  
The reconstruction of the relevant moments will proceed through different phases:

1. Phylogenetics and Periodization  
2. Ancestor assumption \- Proto Kemic  
3. Successor assumption \- Proto Coptic  
4. Diachronic reconstructon  
5. Vertical "approfondimenti"  
6. Phonosyntesis of all phases

## **2. Phylogenetics and Periodization**

### **2.1 Proto-Afroasiatic and Proto-Kemic Roots**

Proto-Afroasiatic, the ancestral language of the Afroasiatic family, serves as the foundation for reconstructing Ancient Egyptian phonology. Spoken in Eastern Sahara between 10,000 BC and 6,000 BC, it is characterized by features such as implosives, labialized consonants, and complex vowel systems. Proto-Kemic, a descendant of Proto-Afroasiatic, represents the earliest identifiable stage of Egyptian.

### **2.2 Timeline of Linguistic Evolution**

#### **Proto-Afroasiatic (PAA) (Prehistory, before 6000 BC)**

The Proto-Afroasiatic phase marks the prehistoric origins of spoken language in this linguistic family. This era is characterized by the early development of phonetics, grammar, and syntax that would later diversify into the Afroasiatic languages. While evidence is limited due to its prehistoric context, reconstructions suggest basic structures and vocabulary that influenced later developments, including Proto-Kemic.

#### **Archaic Egyptian/Proto-Kemic (Old Kingdom, ca. 4000 BC-2600 BC)**

Archaic Egyptian, also known as Proto-Kemic, represents the earliest documented stage of the Egyptian language. This period corresponds to the Old Kingdom, where early hieroglyphic writing began to emerge. Spoken language from this phase likely reflected the establishment of core grammatical structures and the gradual standardization of linguistic features essential for administrative and ceremonial use.

#### **Old Egyptian (Old Kingdom, ca. 2600 BC-2300 BC)**

Old Egyptian saw the refinement of linguistic structures initiated in the Archaic period. This phase includes the Pyramid Texts, one of the earliest known collections of religious inscriptions. Phonological and syntactical innovations became more pronounced, reflecting changes in both spoken and written forms. The language served primarily the elite, maintaining a formal register.

#### **Middle Egyptian (ca. 2300 BC-1300 BC)**

Middle Egyptian represents a significant period in the linguistic evolution, often divided into subphases:

1. **Earlier Middle Egyptian (Old Kingdom, 2300 BC-2100 BC):** Transitional features from Old Egyptian persisted, laying the groundwork for further linguistic refinement.  
2. **Classical Middle Egyptian (Middle Kingdom, 2000 BC-1700 BC):** This phase is considered the classical stage of the language, renowned for its literary and administrative texts. In the written form, it served as a standard for many centuries. It is the first form of the language that we will target in our reconstruction.  
3. **Intermediate Middle Egyptian (1st Intermediate Period, 1700 BC-1550 BC):** Marked by regional dialectal influences and societal disruptions, this period saw the rising of variations in language use across geographic and social contexts.  
4. **Traditional Middle Egyptian (New Kingdom, 18th and earlier 19th dynasty, 1550 BC-1300 BC):** Although Classical Middle Egyptian remained a literary standard, spoken language began shifting towards Late Egyptian characteristics, signaling the start of notable linguistic evolution.

#### **Late Egyptian (ca. 1300 BC-500 BC)**

Late Egyptian emerged during the New Kingdom, reflecting substantial linguistic transformations from its predecessors. Changes included increased use of analytic structures and innovations in syntax. This phase highlights a greater divergence between spoken and written forms, with spoken Late Egyptian exhibiting features closer to the emerging Demotic stage. This is the second form that we will focus on in our reconstruction.

#### **Demotic (ca. 500 BC-250 AD)**

The Demotic phase marks the adaptation of Egyptian to the changing social and political landscape of the later dynastic periods and foreign dominations. Simplifications in grammar and vocabulary are evident, alongside greater integration of loanwords from Greek and other languages. Demotic served both everyday communication and administrative purposes, bridging the gap between Late Egyptian and Coptic.

#### **Standard Coptic (ca. 250 AD-500 AD)**

Standard Coptic represents the final and most stable stage of the Egyptian language as it transitioned fully into a Christian context. Significant phonological shifts occurred, including the adoption of the Greek alphabet to record the language. This phase saw extensive use of Coptic in religious texts, particularly within the early Christian church in Egypt.

#### **Conservative Dialects**
The conservative dialects of Coptic preserve linguistic traits that are closer to earlier stages of the Egyptian language. Sahidic, centered in Upper Egypt around Thebes and Asyut, emerged as the dominant literary dialect, extensively used for early Christian writings and translations of the Bible. It maintained a relatively conservative phonology and grammar, with limited borrowing from Greek compared to more progressive dialects. Akhmimic, spoken in the region around Akhmim, represents an even older and more conservative form, with distinctive phonological features such as vowel mergers and a minimal influence from Greek. In contrast, Subakhmimic (Lycopolitan), found in transitional zones near Akhmim, shows characteristics that blend those of Sahidic and Akhmimic, creating an intermediate form with slightly more progressive tendencies while retaining many conservative traits.

##### **Progressive Dialects**  
The progressive dialects of Coptic exhibit significant phonological and grammatical innovations, often influenced by the Greek language. Bohairic, spoken in the Nile Delta and Alexandria, became the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church and is notable for its extensive adoption of Greek vocabulary and phonological patterns, alongside a simplification of older grammatical structures. Fayyumic, used in the Fayum region southwest of Cairo, is distinguished by unique vowel shifts, such as replacing "o" with "e," and by its distinctive consonantal features, reflecting moderate Greek influence. Oxyrhynchite (Mesokemic), spoken in Middle Egypt around Oxyrhynchus, acts as a transitional dialect, combining both conservative and progressive traits. It features innovations in vowel and consonant pronunciation but had limited use in major literary texts, emphasizing its role as a regional variant.
